# AI-Based Dynamic Lane Management

This repository contains research on the topic **"AI-Based Dynamic Lane Management."** The paper examines the impacts of traffic congestion on health and the environment, analyzing existing literature on the subject. It also explores the potential of machine learning, particularly **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, in managing traffic through advanced traffic management techniques.

The paper focuses on two primary techniques for traffic management:
1. **Dynamic Lane Reversal**
2. **Dynamic Lane Assignment**

It discusses how AI, through Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks, can be leveraged to implement these techniques effectively, optimizing lane usage based on real-time traffic conditions. The application of AI in these areas can significantly reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, and lessen environmental impacts.

All references used in the paper are provided. I hope this research offers valuable insights into how AI can be utilized to address traffic management challenges.
